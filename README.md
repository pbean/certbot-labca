# certbot-labca
improving the distribution of SSL certs created via certbot

I've created this simple unraid community app for my own homelab purposes and wanted to share the work with others. Im sure most people are capable of implementing this on there own but I like the organization of the unraid UI and hate one-offs so this my effort to make this a community app that I can just install and forget about.
